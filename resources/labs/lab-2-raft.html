<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
This is the first in a series of labs in which you'll build a
fault-tolerant key/value storage system. In this
lab you'll implement Raft, a replicated state machine protocol.
In the next lab you'll build a key/value service on top of
Raft. Then you will “shard” your service over
multiple replicated state machines for higher performance.

</p><p>
A replicated service (e.g., key/value database) achieves fault
tolerance by storing copies of its data on multiple replica servers.
Replication allows
the service to continue operating even if some of
its servers experience failures (crashes or a broken or flaky
network). The challenge is that failures may cause the
replicas to hold differing copies of the data.

</p><p>
Raft manages a service's state replicas, and in particular it
helps the service sort out what the correct state is after failures.
Raft implements a replicated state
machine. It organizes client requests into a sequence, called
the log, and ensures that all the replicas agree on the
contents of the log. Each replica executes the client requests
in the log in the order they appear in the log, applying those
requests to the replica's local copy of the service's state. Since all the live replicas
see the same log contents, they all execute the same requests
in the same order, and thus continue to have identical service
state. If a server fails but later recovers, Raft takes care of
bringing its log up to date. Raft will continue to operate as
long as at least a majority of the servers are alive and can
talk to each other. If there is no such majority, Raft will
make no progress, but will pick up where it left off as soon as
a majority can communicate again.

</p><p>
In this lab you'll implement Raft as a Go object type
with associated methods, meant to be used as a module in a
larger service. A set of Raft instances talk to each other with
RPC to maintain replicated logs. Your Raft interface will
support an indefinite sequence of numbered commands, also
called log entries. The entries are numbered with <em>index
numbers</em>. The log entry with a given index will eventually
be committed. At that point, your Raft should send the log
entry to the larger service for it to execute.

</p><p class="note">
Only RPC may be used for interaction between different Raft
instances. For example, different instances of your Raft
implementation are not allowed to share Go variables.
Your implementation should not use files at all.

</p><p>
In this lab you'll implement most of the Raft design
described in the extended paper, including saving
persistent state and reading it after a node fails and
then restarts. You will not implement cluster
membership changes (Section 6) or log compaction /
snapshotting (Section 7).


</p><p>
You should consult the
<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/papers/raft-extended.pdf">extended Raft paper</a>
and the Raft lecture notes.
You may find it useful to look at this
<a href="https://thesquareplanet.com/blog/students-guide-to-raft/">advice</a>
written for 6.824 students in 2016,
and this
<a href="http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/">illustrated guide</a>
to Raft.
For a
wider perspective, have a look at Paxos, Chubby, Paxos Made
Live, Spanner, Zookeeper, Harp, Viewstamped Replication, and
<a href="http://static.usenix.org/event/nsdi11/tech/full_papers/Bolosky.pdf">Bolosky et al.</a>

</p><ul class="hints">
<li>
Start early. Although the amount of code to implement
isn't large, getting it to work correctly will be very
challenging. Both the algorithm and the code is tricky
and there are many corner cases to consider. When one
of the tests fails, it may take a bit of puzzling to
understand in what scenario your solution isn't
correct, and how to fix your solution.

</li><li>
Read and understand the
<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/papers/raft-extended.pdf">extended Raft paper</a>
and the Raft lecture notes before you start. Your
implementation should follow the paper's description
closely, particularly Figure 2, since that's what the tests expect.
</li></ul>

<p>
This lab is due in three parts. You must submit each part on the
corresponding due date. This lab does not involve a lot of code,
but concurrency makes it potentially challenging to debug;
start each part early.

</p><h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>

You must write all the code you hand in for 6.824, except for
code that we give you as part of the assignment. You are not
allowed to look at anyone else's solution, you are not allowed
to look at code from previous years, and you are not allowed to
look at other Raft implementations. You may discuss the
assignments with other students, but you may not look at or
copy anyone else's code, or allow anyone else to look at your code.

<p>
Please do not publish your code or make
it available to current or future 6.824 students.
<tt>github.com</tt> repositories are public by default, so please
don't put your code there unless you make the repository private. You
may find it convenient to use
<a href="https://github.mit.edu/">MIT's GitHub</a>,
but be sure to create a private repository.

</p><h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
Do a <tt>git pull</tt> to get the latest lab software. We
supply you with skeleton code and tests in <tt>src/raft</tt>,
and a simple RPC-like system in <tt>src/labrpc</tt>.

</p><p>
To get up and running, execute the following commands:
</p><pre>$ cd ~/6.824
$ git pull
...
$ cd src/raft
$ GOPATH=~/6.824
$ export GOPATH
$ go test
Test (2A): initial election ...
--- FAIL: TestInitialElection (5.03s)
config.go:270: expected one leader, got 0
Test (2A): election after network failure ...
--- FAIL: TestReElection (5.03s)
config.go:270: expected one leader, got 0
...
$</pre>

When you've finished all three parts of the lab, your implementation should pass all the tests
in the <tt>src/raft</tt> directory:

<pre>$ go test
Test (2A): initial election ...
... Passed
Test (2A): election after network failure ...
... Passed
Test (2B): basic agreement ...
... Passed
...
PASS
ok  	raft	162.413s</pre>

<h3>The code</h3>

Implement Raft by adding code to
<tt>raft/raft.go</tt>. In that file you'll find a bit of
skeleton code, plus examples of how to send and receive
RPCs.

<p>
Your implementation must support the following interface, which
the tester and (eventually) your key/value server will use.
You'll find more details in comments in <tt>raft.go</tt>.

</p><pre>// create a new Raft server instance:
rf := Make(peers, me, persister, applyCh)

// start agreement on a new log entry:
rf.Start(command interface{}) (index, term, isleader)

// ask a Raft for its current term, and whether it thinks it is leader
rf.GetState() (term, isLeader)

// each time a new entry is committed to the log, each Raft peer
// should send an ApplyMsg to the service (or tester).
type ApplyMsg</pre>

<p>
A service calls <tt>Make(peers,me,…)</tt> to create a
Raft peer. The peers argument is an array of established RPC
connections, one to each Raft peer (including this one). The
<tt>me</tt> argument is the index of this peer in the peers
array. <tt>Start(command)</tt> asks Raft to start the processing
to append the command to the replicated log. <tt>Start()</tt>
should return immediately, without waiting for this process
to complete. The service expects your implementation to send an
<tt>ApplyMsg</tt> for each new committed log entry to the
<tt>applyCh</tt> argument to <tt>Make()</tt>.

</p><p>
Your Raft peers should exchange RPCs using the labrpc Go
package that we provide to you. It is modeled after Go's
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/">rpc library</a>, but internally uses
Go channels rather than sockets.
<tt>raft.go</tt> contains some example code that sends an RPC
(<tt>sendRequestVote()</tt>) and that handles an incoming RPC
(<tt>RequestVote()</tt>).  The reason you must use <tt>labrpc</tt> instead of
Go's RPC package is that the tester tells <tt>labrpc</tt> to delay RPCs,
re-order them, and delete them to simulate challenging network conditions under
which your code should work correctly.  Don't modify <tt>labrpc</tt> because we
will test your code with the <tt>labrpc</tt> as handed out.

</p><p>This lab may be your first exposure to writing challenging concurrent code
and your first implementation may not be clean enough that you can easily reason
about its correctness.  Give yourself enough time to rewrite your implementation
so that you can easily reason about its correctness. Subsequent labs will build
on this lab, so it is important to do a good job on your implementation.

</p><h3>Part 2A</h3>

<p class="todo">
Implement leader election and heartbeats (<tt>AppendEntries</tt> RPCs with no
log entries). The goal for Part 2A is for a
single leader to be elected, for the leader to remain the leader
if there are no failures, and for a new leader to take over if the
old leader fails or if packets to/from the old leader are lost.
Run <tt>go test -run 2A</tt> to test your 2A code.

</p><ul class="hints">
<li>
Add any state you need to the <tt>Raft</tt>
struct in <tt>raft.go</tt>.
You'll also need to define a
struct to hold information about each log entry.
Your code should follow Figure 2 in the paper as
closely as possible.

</li><li>Go RPC sends only struct fields whose names start with capital letters.
  Sub-structures must also have capitalized field names (e.g. fields of log records
  in an array). Forgetting to capitalize field names sent by RPC is the
  single most frequent source of bugs in these labs.

</li><li>
Fill in the <tt>RequestVoteArgs</tt> and
<tt>RequestVoteReply</tt> structs. Modify
<tt>Make()</tt> to create a background goroutine that will kick off leader
 election periodically by sending out <tt>RequestVote</tt> RPCs when it hasn't
 heard from another peer for a while.  This way a peer will learn who is the
 leader, if there is already a leader, or become the leader itself.  Implement
 the <tt>RequestVote()</tt> RPC handler so that servers will vote for one
 another.


</li><li>
To implement heartbeats, define an
<tt>AppendEntries</tt> RPC struct (though you may not
need all the arguments yet), and have the leader send
them out periodically. Write an
<tt>AppendEntries</tt> RPC handler method that resets
the election timeout so that other servers don't step
forward as leaders when one has already been elected.

</li><li>
Make sure the election timeouts in different peers don't always fire
at the same time, or else all peers will vote only for themselves and no
one will become the leader.

</li><li>
The tester requires that the leader send heartbeat RPCs no more than
ten times per second.

</li><li>
The tester requires your Raft to elect a new leader within five seconds of the
failure of the old leader (if a majority of peers can still
communicate). Remember, however, that leader election may require multiple
rounds in case of a split vote (which can happen if packets are lost or if
candidates unluckily choose the same random backoff times). You must pick
election timeouts (and thus heartbeat intervals) that are short enough that it's
very likely that an election will complete in less than five seconds even if it
requires multiple rounds.

</li><li>
The paper's Section 5.2 mentions election timeouts in the range of 150
to 300 milliseconds. Such a range only makes sense if the leader
sends heartbeats considerably more often than once per 150
milliseconds. Because the tester limits you to 10 heartbeats per
second, you will have to use an election timeout larger
than the paper's 150 to 300 milliseconds, but not too large, because then you
may fail to elect a leader within five seconds.

</li><li>
You may find Go's
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Sleep">time.Sleep()</a>
and
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/">rand</a>
useful.

</li><li>
You'll need to write code that takes actions periodically or
after delays in time. The easiest way to do this is to create
a goroutine with a loop that calls
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Sleep">time.Sleep()</a>.

</li><li>
If your code has trouble passing the tests,
read the paper's Figure 2 again; the full logic for leader
election is spread over multiple parts of the figure.

</li><li>
A good way to debug your code is to insert print statements when a peer sends or
receives a message, and collect the output in a file with
<tt>go test -run 2A &gt; out</tt>.  Then, by studying the trace of messages in
the <tt>out</tt> file, you can identify where your implementation deviates
from the desired protocol.  You might find <tt>DPrintf</tt> in <tt>util.go</tt>
useful to turn printing on and off as you debug different problems.

</li><li>You should check your code with <tt>go test -race</tt>, and fix
any races it reports.

</li></ul>

<p>
Be sure you pass the 2A tests before submitting Part 2A.  Note that the 2A tests
test the basic operation of leader election. Parts B and C will test leader
election in more challenging settings and may expose bugs in your leader
election code which the 2A tests miss.

</p><h3>Part 2B</h3>

We want
Raft to keep a consistent, replicated log of operations.
A call to <tt>Start()</tt> at the leader starts the process
of adding a new operation to the log;
the leader sends the new operation to the other servers
in <tt>AppendEntries</tt> RPCs.

<p class="todo">
Implement the leader and follower code to append new log entries.
This will involve implementing <tt>Start()</tt>, completing the
<tt>AppendEntries</tt> RPC structs, sending them, fleshing out
the <tt>AppendEntry</tt> RPC handler, and advancing the <tt>commitIndex</tt> at
the leader.
Your first goal should
be to pass the <tt>TestBasicAgree()</tt> test (in
<tt>test_test.go</tt>). Once you have that working, you should
get all the 2B tests to pass (<tt>go test -run 2B</tt>).

</p><ul class="hints">

<li>
You will need to implement the election
restriction (section 5.4.1 in the paper).

</li><li>
While the Raft leader is the only server that initiates appends of new entries
to the log, all the servers need to independently give each newly committed
entry to their local service replica (via their own <tt>applyCh</tt>).  You
should try to keep the goroutines that implement the Raft protocol
as separate as possible from the code that sends committed log entries on the
<tt>applyCh</tt> (e.g., by using a separate goroutine for delivering committed
messages). If you don't separate these activities cleanly, then it is easy to
create deadlocks, either in this lab or in subsequent labs in which you
implement services that use your Raft package. Without a clean separation, a
common deadlock scenario is as follows: an RPC handler sends on
the <tt>applyCh</tt> but it blocks because no goroutine is reading from the
channel (e.g., perhaps because it called <tt>Start()</tt>). Now, the RPC handler
is blocked while holding the mutex on the Raft structure.  The reading goroutine
is also blocked on the mutex because <tt>Start()</tt> needs to acquire
it. Furthermore, no other RPC handler that needs the lock on the Raft structure
can run.

</li><li>Give yourself enough time to rewrite your implementation because only after
  writing a first implementation will you realize how to organize your code
  cleanly. For example, only after writing one implementation will you
  understand how to write an implementation that makes it easy to argue that
  your implementation has no deadlocks.

</li><li>
Figure out the minimum number of messages Raft should
use when reaching agreement in non-failure cases and
make your implementation use that minimum.

</li><li>
You may need to write code that waits for certain events to occur.
Do not write loops that execute continuously without pausing, since that
will slow your implementation enough that it fails tests.
You can wait efficiently with Go's channels,
or Go's
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Cond">condition variables</a>,
or (if all else fails) by inserting a
<tt>time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond)</tt> in each loop iteration.

</li></ul>

<p>
Be sure you pass the 2A and 2B tests before submitting Part 2B.

</p><h3>Part 2C</h3>

<p>
If a Raft-based server reboots it should resume service
where it left off. This requires
that Raft keep persistent state that survives a reboot. The
paper's Figure 2 mentions which state should be persistent,
and <tt>raft.go</tt> contains examples of how to save and
restore persistent state.

</p><p>
A “real” implementation would do this by writing
Raft's persistent state to disk each time it changes, and reading the latest saved
state from
disk when restarting after a reboot. Your implementation won't use
the disk; instead, it will save and restore persistent state
from a <tt>Persister</tt> object (see <tt>persister.go</tt>).
Whoever calls <tt>Raft.Make()</tt> supplies a <tt>Persister</tt>
that initially holds Raft's most recently persisted state (if
any). Raft should initialize its state from that
<tt>Persister</tt>, and should use it to save its persistent
state each time the state changes. Use the <tt>Persister</tt>'s
<tt>ReadRaftState()</tt> and <tt>SaveRaftState()</tt> methods.

</p><p class="todo">
Implement persistence by first adding code that saves
and restores persistent state to
<tt>persist()</tt>
and
<tt>readPersist()</tt> in <tt>raft.go</tt>. You will need to encode
(or "serialize") the state as an array of bytes in order to pass it to
the <tt>Persister</tt>. Use Go's <tt>gob</tt> encoder to do this;
see the comments in <tt>persist()</tt> and <tt>readPersist()</tt>.

</p><p class="todo">
You now
need to determine at what points in the Raft protocol your
servers are required to persist their state, and insert calls
to <tt>persist()</tt> in those places.
You must also load persisted state in <tt>Raft.Make()</tt>.
Once you've done this,
you should pass the remaining tests.  You may want to
first try to pass the "basic persistence" test (<tt>go test
-run 'TestPersist12C'</tt>), and then tackle the remaining ones (<tt>go test -run
    2C</tt>).

</p><p class="note">
In order to avoid running out of memory, Raft must periodically
discard old log entries, but you <strong>do not</strong> have
to worry about this until the next lab.

</p><ul class="hints">
<li>
Many of the 2C tests involve
servers failing and the network losing RPC requests or replies.

</li><li>
The Go <tt>gob</tt> encoder you'll use to encode persistent state only saves
fields whose names start with upper case letters. Using small
caps for field names is a common source of mysterious bugs, since Go doesn't
warn you that they won't be saved.


</li><li>
In order to pass some of the challenging tests towards the end, such as
those marked "unreliable", you will need to implement the optimization to
allow a follower to back up the leader's nextIndex by more than one entry
at a time. See the description in the <a +href="../papers/raft-extended.pdf">extended Raft paper</a> starting at
the bottom of page 7 and top of page 8 (marked by a gray line).
The paper is vague about the details; you will need to fill in the gaps,
perhaps with the help of the 6.824 Raft lectures.
